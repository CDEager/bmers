Title: Bayesian Mixed Effects Regressions Fit with Stan
Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: person("Christopher D.", "Eager",

Description: bmers fits Bayesian mixed effects regressions with weakly
    informative priors and maximal random effects structures in Stan with
    the No U-Turn Sampler (through the rstan interface). The maximal random
    effects structure is determined automatically, continuous variables are
    automatically scaled, factor contrasts are automatically set, and NA
    values in both the fixed and random effects are supported.
