#' An S4 class to store control parameters for \code{\link{bmer}}
#'
#' Stores hyperparameters for the priors, determines the amount of function printing,
#' and gives instructions for how variable scaling, factor contrasts, and NA values are to be handled.
#'
#' It is very important to note that the default weakly-informative priors are set assuming that \code{scale_cont} and
#' \code{set_contr} are both set to TRUE. These parameters should only be set to FALSE if you have a lot of experience
#' with Bayesian modeling and can properly adjust the priors.  See the vignette for more details.
#'
#' @slot verbose Logical. If TRUE, summaries of the \linkS4class{bmerBuild} and \linkS4class{bmerFit} are printed when
#' \code{\link{bmer}} is called. If FALSE (the default), only warning messages (if any) are printed.
#' @slot scale_cont Logical. If TRUE (the default), continuous variables are scaled (i.e. mean-centered and divided by their
#' standard deviation) so that they have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 prior to regression. If FALSE (highly not recommended),
#' continuous variables are left on their original scales.
#' @slot set_contr Logical. If TRUE (the default), sum contrasts are set for unordered factors and scaled orthogonal polynomial
#' contrasts are set for ordered factors prior to regression. If FALSE (highly not recommended), factor contrasts are not checked.
#' @slot estimate_scale_beta Character. One of "P", "yes", or "no". If "yes", the scale of the fixed effect t-distribution prior
#' is estimated with a hyper-prior which is assigned a half-normal distribution with scale \code{sc_beta}. If "no" (the default), the prior scale
#' is not estimated with a hyper-prior, and is instead given a value of \code{scale_beta}.  If "P", then
#' \code{estimate_scale_beta} is interpreted as "yes" if there are 10 or more fixed effect coefficients, and as "no" if there are
#' fewer than 10 fixed effect coefficients.
#' @slot sc_beta Numeric (default 1; must be greater than 0). The scale for the half-normal hyper-prior on the scale of the
#' fixed effect t-distribution prior if a hyper-prior is assigned (depends on \code{estimate_scale_beta}).
#' @slot scale_beta Numeric (default 2; must be greater than 0). The scale for the fixed effect t-distribution prior if a
#' hyper-prior is not assigned (depends on \code{estimate_scale_beta}).
#' @slot nu_beta Numeric (default 5; must be greater than 0). The degrees of freedom for the fixed effect t-distribution prior.
#' Setting to 1 results in a Cauchy prior.
#' @slot sc_q0 Numeric (default is 1.5; must be greater than 0). The scale for the half-normal prior on the standard deviation in
#' the random intercepts.
#' @slot sc_qs Numeric (default is 1; must be greater than 0). The scale for the half-normal prior on the standard deviation in
#' the random slopes.
#' @slot eta_q Numeric (default is 2; must be greater than 0). The shape parameter for the LKJ prior on the random effects
#' correlation matrices. Setting to 1 results in a flat prior.
#' @slot sc_res Numeric (default is 0.5; must be greater than 0). The scale for the half-normal prior on the standard deviation in
#' the residuals.  Only applies to linear (i.e. Gaussian) regressions.
#' @slot fixef_na Logical. If FALSE (the default), observations with NA values in the fixed effects are dropped. If TRUE, then
#' \code{set_contr} must also be TRUE, and NA values will be set to 0 in the model matrix (i.e. level slashing). When an unordered
#' factor with NA values is involved in interactions, the interaction term is checked for higher-order NA values and, if necessary,
#' the contrasts for the factors with NA values are changed for the interaction term, and these new contrasts which apply to the
#' interaction term but not the main effects are logged. In regression output, interaction terms with contrast changes are prefixed
#' with "nai_" so that they can be easily identified. See the vignette for examples.
#' @slot ranef_na Logical. If FALSE (the default), observations with NA values in the random effect grouping factors are dropped.
#' If TRUE, then set_contr must also be TRUE, and NA values will be set to 0 in the model matrix. When a within-group fixed effect
#' factor only takes on a subset of its values when the random grouping factor is not NA, then the contrasts for the factor are
#' changed in the coding of slopes for the random effect grouping factor, and the new contrasts which apply to the slope but not the
#' fixed effect are logged. In the regression output, these slopes are prefixed with the name of the random effect grouping factor
#' so they can be easily identified.
