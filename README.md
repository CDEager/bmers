# The *bmers* package

The functionality the *bmers* package offered is now (mostly) available in the *standardize* and *nauf* packages.  The *standardize* package more flexibly handles the automatic standardization *bmers* did, and the *nauf* package handles the NA values the way *bmers* did.  The *nauf* package does not yet support Bayesian models, but compatibility with *rstanarm* is coming soon.
